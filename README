== Welcome to Flush to Piwi!

This little project tries to find out all swimming pools in Spain by asking volunteers to find them using Google Maps. Volunteers will trace the swimmin pool ideally so that we can determine its size.

Did you know that there are more than 1.1 million private swimming pools in Spain? That is without the public ones. We hear a lot how bad golf is for water resources, but actually there is only 547 golf courses in Spain. Additionally there is probably a lot of "illegal" pools out there. We want to know!

== Abredatos 2011

This project is our participation as #t69 to Abredatos 2011. We only had 5 hours on Sunday to work on it so dont expect much code in here...
